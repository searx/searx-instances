        Your instance will receive requests from the host `check.searx.space` (the IP addresses of this host may change in the future).
        Currently, if you don't give the right to `check.searx.space` to check your instance, it is not possible to add your instance to the list.
      options:
      - label: "It is my instance."

      - label: "I give the right to check.searx.space to check my instance (every 3 hours for the response times, every 24 hours for the other tests)."

        Do you have installed a bot protection ?

        Be sure to have configured a bot protection:
        * once your instance is added to searx.space, it will receive requests from different bots which may increase its chance of getting blocked by various search engines.
        * removing your instance from searx.space won't stop the bots and thus will most likely not unblock it from the various search engines.

        We recommend the usage of [filtron](https://github.com/asciimoo/filtron) for the bot protection or you may also take a look at [antibot-proxy](https://github.com/unixfox/antibot-proxy/).
        
        ⚠️ If you have installed [filtron](https://github.com/asciimoo/filtron), we urge you to use the [rules from searx-docker](https://github.com/searx/searx-docker/blob/master/rules.json). Please double check if you are using them.
      options:
        - "No, I have not installed a bot protection and I do recognize that without one, my instance will be flooded by bots and could have some of its engines stop working (an example is Google)."
        - "Yes, I have installed filtron (rules.json from searx-docker)."
        - "Yes, I have installed filtron (other rules)."
        - "Yes, I have installed antibot-proxy or another bot protection."
